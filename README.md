st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.

This fork has the following useful (to me) patches applied:
- [alpha](https://st.suckless.org/patches/alpha/)
- [hide-cursor](https://st.suckless.org/patches/hidecursor/)
- [solarized-both](https://st.suckless.org/patches/solarized/)
- [clipboard](https://st.suckless.org/patches/clipboard/)
- [right-click-paste](https://st.suckless.org/patches/rightclickpaste/)


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files. This fork also requires the [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) font.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
